MINGW32 Windows PORT of gettext by Franco Bez <franco.bez@gmx.de>

alternate DLL interface to GNU getetxt

if you want to use GNU gettext as a DLL in your application, but you do not
want that gnu_gettext.dll is required for your application to run, 
you might want to use this interface.

It is tried to dynamically load the gnu_gettext.dll , if the dll is not found
no translation will take place, but your application will run normally.

usage

just include safe_gettext_dll.cpp in your project, and define USE_SAFE_GETTEXT_DLL before
including libintl.h - that's about all.
You can use this interface with C or C++.

If you're using plain C for your project you'll have to
  - compile safe_gettext_dll.cpp with C++
  - link your apllication to the resulting object file AND the standard C++ library
  i.e. mingw32
    to compile the interface:
      g++ -O -c -o safe_gettext_dll.o safe_gettext_dll.cpp
    to link your application
      gcc -O -s -o YourApp.exe YourObjects.o safe_gettext_dll.o -lstdc++ -lYourLibs
